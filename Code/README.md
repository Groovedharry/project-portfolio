Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

We were tasked with creating our own portfolio following a design made by technigo.

## The problem
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I had problems with setting up the HTML as I never found it to be efficent and well done so I remade the HTML skeleton too many times to count I then decided that enough was enough and just went with what I had.

The portfolio design was in Figma so have been using a lot of figma this week. I am very experienced with Figma so it wasn't a problem for me to use it and work with it.
