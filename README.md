# Your Very Own Portfolio üî•

It's about time you show the world the wonders that you're now capable of building ‚Äì it's time to build your portfolio. The portfolio should feature projects you have built so far and some information about yourself and your background, and, if you'd like, your contact details.

The portfolio will be a great test of your HTML and CSS skills but we will also take the opporitunity to introduce a few testing methods and some things that every frontend developer should know. 

The portfolio contains of: 
* Landing page - the page which lists all your projects and could briefly mention who you are.
* Project pages - a page which will be used to describe a project (daily assignment or group project) with images, a description, a list of technologies used and a link to the project live (Will be added on session 3).

You can choose to either create one project page per project so you can style them each manually, or to create a reusable page which can use a json file as a "database" and use a parameter in the url to choose which project to show.

*If you are taking the ful program and plan to let us match you with comanies in the end of the program we want you to use the design that are provided in the assets folder. For this weeks project, focus on getting the tech side nice. For the matchning process, also the content becomes important ‚Äì this is something that we can add more love to later in the course. This is a page that we will use to profile you towards companies. Your portfolio will need constant updates with new projects from now on.*

If you don't want our help getting interviews, feel free to build the portfolio anyway you like. Here's some examples.

## How to get started üí™üèº

Because this is your portfolio, you will own the repository! On Github, create a new repository for yourself to get started. You can initialize it with a README if you'd like - it doesn't really matter. Once you have your repository, clone it onto your computer. 

:warning: Code reviews are difficult without Pull Requests, so you need to make sure that your repository is public and then submit a link to your repo in the hand-in on Canvas. :warning:

## Test Your Webpage üèº‚úÖ

A big part of this project is to test your page so that it works for all the most used browsers and works well for people with dissabilities.

The next step is to make sure your webpage works well for people with disabilities. You should each step on the [Accessibility testing checklist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility) at the bottom of the page and make adjustments for those error that you find. Feel free to discuss in Slack what you find and how to solve some issues.

Talk to your team on Slack and help each other out. Do some research about your problem, you are surely not the first one with this problem, Google is your friend üôÇ. And you can of course also book a tech call. 

## Stretch Goals üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ
